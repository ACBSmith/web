		<h1>Producing an ebook for Standard Ebooks</h1>
		<p>Our tools and processes are all open source, so anyone with the right technical and editorial knowledge can produce a new Standard Ebooks ebook!</p>
		<p>Here’s what the process of getting an ebook on Standard Ebooks looks like.</p>
		<ol>
			<li>
				<p>Review the <a href="/contribute/accepted-ebooks">kinds of ebooks we do and don’t accept</a>.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>Find a good first production in our <a href="/contribute/wanted-ebooks">Wanted Ebooks list</a>, or if there’s nothing there that interests you, find a straightforward book of no longer than about 40–60,000 words, without much complex formatting like poetry, letters, diagrams, or illustrations. After your first production, you can move on to working on longer or more complex works.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>Contact the <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/standardebooks">Standard Ebooks mailing list</a> to pitch the ebook you’ve selected, <em>before you begin production</em>.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>Carefully review the entirety of the Standard Ebooks <a href="/contribute/typography">Typography Manual</a>, <a href="/contribute/semantics">Semantics Manual</a>, and <a href="/contribute/metadata">Metadata Manual</a>.</p>
			<li>
				<p>Once we’ve OK’d your selection and you’ve read the style manuals, you can get started! Follow the steps in our <a href="/contribute/producing-an-ebook-step-by-step">step-by-step guide to producing an ebook</a> to take your ebook from start to finish.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>Once you’ve finished your ebook and completed a complete cover-to-cover proofread, contact the <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/standardebooks">Standard Ebooks mailing list</a> and we’ll assign a reviewer to review your work.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>Most first productions have a significant amount of errors. Not to worry! Once you've fixed them, contact the mailing list again.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>Your ebook will be released! Congratulations, and now it's time for others to enjoy the fruits of your hard work!</p>
